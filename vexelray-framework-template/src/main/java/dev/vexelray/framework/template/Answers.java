/**
 * What somebody said, and what follows from it.
 *
 * <p>Everything is text here, including the yes-or-nos, and that is deliberate:
 * the same answers have to arrive from a form somebody filled in, from a record
 * that came down a pipe, and from a line of {@code --set}, and the one
 * shape all three can agree on is a name and a string. Reading them as anything
 * richer is the shell's business, and the shell has already done it by the time
 * they get here.
 *
 * <p>Substitution is deliberately dumb. {@code ${name}} and nothing else -- no
 * expressions, no conditionals, no loops. A template is a folder somebody may
 * have been handed, and a template language that could compute is a template
 * language that can be made to do something other than what it looks like it
 * does. What it will not do quietly is leave a {@code ${placeholder}} in a
 * generated file: an unknown name is refused, with the list of ones that exist.
