 * Every file a template would write, worked out before any of them is written.

 * that can fail on its last file should fail before its first. Here it buys one
 * more thing -- the collision check is a comparison of two lists rather than a
 * question asked halfway through, so "this would land on a file you already have"
 * is something the person is told while nothing has happened yet.
 *
 * <p>Rendering happens here too, which is to say that by the time this exists,
 * every {@code ${placeholder}} has already been either substituted or refused.
 * A blueprint holds bytes.
