/**
 * A template: what to ask for, and what to write once it has been answered.
 *
 * <p>Data, not code. A template is read out of a manifest and is inert until
 * something hands it a set of answers -- which is what lets the same definition
 * drive the form a person fills in, the check a script runs over a record it
 * built itself, and the listing {@code templates} prints. There is no second
 * description of a template anywhere.
 *
 * <p>The engine knows nothing about any particular template, and that is the
 * point rather than a nicety: the day a second one is added, the only new thing
 * in the world should be a folder of files and a manifest beside them.

 *             with {@code mvn compile exec:exec} and a folder of notes ends with
 *             nothing at all, and a shell that guessed would be confidently wrong
 *             for every template but the one it was written against.
