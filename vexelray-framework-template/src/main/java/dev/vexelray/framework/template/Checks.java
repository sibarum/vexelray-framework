 * script both get. What is here is the rest: the things that need a word list
 * (a package segment called {@code new} matches every sensible pattern and will
 * not compile), the things that need the disk (is there anything in that folder
 * already?), and the one thing that needs the machine (is the library this
 * project is about to depend on actually installed?).
 *
 * <h2>Two kinds, and the difference matters</h2>
 *
 * <p>A <b>refusal</b> stops the whole thing before a byte is written. A
 * <b>caution</b> is said out loud and carried on from. The line between them is
 * not severity, it is certainty: a package name that will not compile is a
 * refusal because it is not a matter of opinion, and a missing artifact in the
 * local repository is a caution because the person may be about to install it, or
 * may be building against something this code cannot see.
 *
 * <p>The exception is the destination, where everything is a refusal. Nothing here
 * ever writes over a file that is already there, and no flag turns that off --
