/**
 * The application's one tempo, on the framework's clock.
 *
 * <h2>Motion is opt-in, so it is easy to lose</h2>
 *
 * <p>A widget animates only when it is handed a {@link Ramp} — {@code Tabs.slide}, {@code TreeView.motion},
 * {@code Cues} — and without one it cuts. So leaving the clock out costs no error and no warning, only a stiffer
 * window. That is deliberate in the widget shelf (vexelray-gui-widget knows nothing about time, and reduced motion
 * is simply not handing one over), and it is why the ramps are made here, in one place, from one clock.
 *
 * <p>Two durations, and they differ on purpose. A change — a tab arriving, a folder opening — should be over before
 * Ctrl+Tab held down could want the next one. A cue has to be <em>noticed</em>, and once its attack and release
 * are taken out a cue as short as a change has too little visible motion left.
 *
 * <p>{@code settle} on the automation socket waits these out, so a script's photograph is of the window at rest.
