# TODO

Work on **${title}** that is known about and not done. Distinct from
[framework-notes.md](framework-notes.md), which is about the framework rather than about this application —
if the fix belongs upstream, it goes there instead.

Keep an entry short enough that it does not need editing, and delete it when it is done rather than ticking it.

## Next

- [ ] Decide what this application is. It starts as an editor because an editor reaches every seam; keep the parts
      yours needs and delete the rest. `Recipes` is the place to start, since every part is one method there.
- [ ] Replace the palette anchors in `Look.java` with the design's, measured in Oklab. See the note in that file
      about which authored colours the construction can reproduce and which have to be declared.

## Later

- [ ] Automation coverage: `-Dautomation=on` opens a driving socket, and the landmarks in `Landmarks.java` are
      already the names a script would use. One scripted run through the main path is worth more than several
      unit tests of the view.
