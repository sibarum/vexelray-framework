/**
 * What this application builds — one recipe per part — and nothing about when.
 *
 * <h2>The wiring is generated from this</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ${className}Wiring} is written by {@code vexelray-framework-processor} while this project compiles, and
 * lands in {@code target/generated-sources/annotations}. It calls each method below once, in the phase its
 * parameters put it in: <b>a part's phase is the latest phase of anything it takes.</b> So the look, the model and
 * the session store exist before the {@code Gui} does; the window's contents wait for the {@code Gui}, its clock and
 * its title bar; and the restore, which takes the {@code Shell}, comes last, when the window and the dialogs exist.
 * There is no phase to declare and none to get wrong. Open the generated file after a build to see the order.
 *
 * <p>The driving socket is not here. It comes from {@code AutomationStarter}, which {@link ${className}} names in
 * its {@code @VexelApp}.
 *
 * <h2>What is not here is the point</h2>
 *
 * <p>Opening an input backend, installing a clipboard, remembering where the window was, attaching a clock, wiring
 * the frame loop with its wakes and its pacing, parsing the command line, installing the dialogs, and closing
 * everything in the right order are all {@code vexelray-framework}'s. So is closing the parts that are
 * {@code AutoCloseable}.
 *
 * <p>Adding a part is a method here. It returns an interface when other code should be able to swap it; this
 * package's own classes may be returned as they are, because nothing outside the package could hold a call site
 * against them anyway.
