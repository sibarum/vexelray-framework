# ${title}

${summary}

A VexelRay desktop application, generated from the `vexel-desktop` template: a small text editor with tabs, a file
navigator and Markdown in colour. It is the reference implementation of this stack, so every seam the framework
offers is wired in the tree you are reading — and it is a working editor, so it is also something to change into
whatever you are actually building.

## Run it

```
mvn compile exec:exec
```

`exec:exec` rather than `exec:java`, so native access can be enabled for Panama FFM. The window comes up where you
last left it, at ${width}x${height} the first time, with the folder and the files you last had open. The first time,
the navigator shows the working directory.

```
mvn compile exec:exec "-Dapp.args=C:/notes"               # open a folder (or files) named on the command line
mvn compile exec:exec -Dapp.args=120                      # 120 frames and quit
mvn compile exec:exec -Dautomation=0                      # a driving socket on a free port (see Taking a screenshot)
mvn test                                                  # the model, the file policy, Markdown, the real tree headless
```

## A native executable

Two editions, built with GraalVM native-image (a GraalVM JDK as `JAVA_HOME`, and a Visual Studio developer prompt,
which native-image needs for `link.exe` and the icon step needs for `rc.exe`):

```
mvn -Pnative-release package -DskipTests      # target/${artifactId}.exe        what ships: no console, no driving socket
mvn -Pnative package -DskipTests              # target/${artifactId}-debug.exe  a console, and ottermate can drive it
```

`${className}App`, the class the processor reads, is written twice — `src/edition-debug` names `AutomationStarter`
and `src/edition-release` does not — and the pom compiles one. Keep the two annotations identical apart from
`starters`. Everything else is shared; an ordinary build, `exec:exec` and the tests are the debug edition.

This program's own native-image metadata is `src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/.../reachability-metadata.json`,
and it is short because almost nothing is this program's: the libraries register their own, and the processor
registers the icon. If a native run fails on something the JVM run did not (a `Missing...RegistrationError`), run the
debug edition on a JVM under `-agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=...`, do the thing that failed, and add
only the entries that name this program.

## The icon

`src/main/rc/${artifactId}.ico` is the application's mark, and it is one file read three ways: the window and its
taskbar button wear it (`@VexelApp(icon = ${className}.ICON)`; the pom puts it on the class path), the `.exe` links it
(`src/main/rc/${artifactId}.rc`), and so Explorer, a shortcut and a pinned button show it too. It starts as the
framework's "new app" mark, whose source is `${artifactId}.svg` beside it.

To make it yours, draw a 64x64 SVG and render it at every size Windows asks for, 16 to 256 px, into that `.ico` —
`vex-suite-common`'s `tools/Ico.java` does exactly this, from each size's own rasterisation rather than shrinking the
largest. Replace the file, and the window and the executable change together. An `.ico` or `.png` that is missing is
a compile error; one that does not decode costs the window its mark, logged, and nothing else.

Run from `mvn exec:exec`, the process is `java.exe`, so the window and its taskbar button wear the mark but Windows
groups the button with other Java programs, and pinning it pins Java. The native executable has neither problem.

## Using it

| Keys | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+L | the path bar: type a folder to show it, a file to open it, a new name to create it; Enter goes |
| Ctrl+S | save |
| Ctrl+W | close the tab (asks if it is unsaved) |
| Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+PageDown / Ctrl+Shift+Tab, Ctrl+PageUp | next / previous tab |
| Ctrl+Shift+E | put the keyboard in the navigator |
| Ctrl+F | find in the file (Enter / Shift+Enter step, Escape closes) |
| Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y | undo / redo |
| Ctrl+= / Ctrl+- / Ctrl+0 | zoom |

Selecting a file in the navigator opens it — a click, or walking the tree with the arrow keys, which keep the
keyboard in the tree. A tab's menu has Save, Close, Close others, Close all and Reveal in navigator. A bullet in
front of a tab's name means unsaved changes; closing anything unsaved asks first, and so does quitting.

There is no native file dialog, on purpose: this project uses nothing native beyond what the framework brings, so it
builds wherever the framework does. The path bar is the whole of "open".

## How it is put together

Read these in this order.

| File | What belongs in it |
| --- | --- |
| `Recipes.java` | **what this application builds.** One `@Provides` method per part; `${className}AppWiring`, which builds them in order, is generated from it while the project compiles. A part's phase is the latest phase of anything it takes, so there is none to declare. New parts go here. |
| `Doc.java`, `Model.java` | the shape of the session — which files, which in front, which unsaved, which folder — as one immutable value, changed only by functions of the current value, committed through atchung's `State`. |
| `Ui.java` | the window. Holds no state; `show(Doc)` writes everything derived from the session. |
| `Workspace.java`, `Buffer.java` | the tab bar and one `Buffer` per tab: a `TextField`, its spans, its save bookkeeping. |
| `Navigator.java`, `FolderSource.java` | the path bar and the file tree, over the disk, read lazily off the frame loop. |
| `Actions.java` | every command, the questions some of them ask, and the close gate. |
| `Session.java` | what comes back next time, in the framework's one settings store. |
| `Motion.java` | the one tempo every widget moves at, on the framework's clock. |
| `text/TextFile.java`, `text/Markdown.java` | **code with no `Gui` in it**, in a sub-package with public types: the policy between bytes and text, and Markdown as spans. Testable in milliseconds; this is where a real application's non-GUI code goes. |

`${className}.java` is the entry point and the constants, and nothing else. The application edge — input, the
clipboard, window memory, the clock, the frame loop with its wakes and its pacing, the dialogs, the command line and
the shutdown order — is `vexelray-framework`'s. `Look.java`, `Type.java` and `Landmarks.java` are the three
vocabularies: colour, size, and the names an automation script is allowed to depend on.

### Phases

A phase is a **correctness** constraint rather than a scheduling detail, and having them as a type is what makes the
constraints structural instead of remembered:

| phase | what exists by then |
| --- | --- |
| `CONFIG` | the settings store and the look — values, before there is a `Gui` to apply them to |
| `MODEL` | what the application knows, before there is anything to draw it with |
| `GUI` | the `Gui` and the clock; the theme applied and the zoom range set, before the first widget |
| `TREE` | the widgets. Buildable with no window, which is what lets a test build it with no GPU |
| `WINDOW` | the device and the window handle. Main-thread from here on |
| `ATTACH` | anything that needed the handle: chrome controls, the close gate, the driving socket |

Open `target/generated-sources/annotations/.../${className}AppWiring.java` after a build to see which part landed where.

### Threading, in one paragraph

The GUI loop runs on its own thread. Every handler — a click, a key, a submitted path — runs on a worker, and every
read and write of a file runs on the offload lane, so a slow disk is never a frozen window. Workers meet at `Model`,
whose compare-and-set puts concurrent changes in an order. A listener registered with `Model.onChange` fires on the
committing thread; writing a node's props from there is correct, because a prop written off the GUI thread is applied
by the next drain. Two rules keep it deadlock-free, and both are written on `Workspace`: nothing commits to the model
while holding the workspace's lock, and nothing a model listener reaches takes it. Nothing inside the frame loop
reads the model.

### Spans

`Markdown.spans` is a pure function from text to `Span`s — foreground, background, underline — and `Buffer` runs it
on a worker after each edit and hands the result to the field. The text is never changed; the field draws the
colours and moves each span with its text as you type. A `.txt` file gets none.

### Motion

The widgets animate only when handed a ramp, and without one they cut — so leaving the clock out costs no error,
only a stiffer window. `Motion` makes the ramps from the framework's clock: the tabs slide, folders open, and a cue
rings a tab you asked to open that was already open, or the status line when something was refused.

## The stack

Everything below is installed locally rather than downloaded, so `mvn install` in each of those projects has to have
happened at least once. If the build cannot resolve them, that is why.

| what | why it is here |
| --- | --- |
| `vexelray-framework-shell`, `-automation`, `-processor` | the application edge, the driving socket, and the processor that writes the wiring |
| `vexelray-gui-widget` | the widgets: `Tabs`, `TreeView`, `TextField`, `SplitPane`, `StatusBar`, `Cues` |
| `vexelray-gui-krono` | the clock: every transition and cue |
| `vexelray-gui-automation` | driving the running app the way a person does — a debugging instrument |
| `tactroller-atchung` | keyboard and pointer input onto an atchung bus (brings `atchung-core`) |
| `tactroller-clipboard` | the OS clipboard, with no input-subsystem coupling |
| `vexelray-os-*`, `tactroller-*` | picked by an OS-activated profile; exactly one activates |

## Taking a screenshot

Screenshots are `ottermate`'s, and only its: it photographs the running window on the application's own device, so
the picture is right about content as well as chrome. There is no `--capture` flag in this project on purpose.

```
ottermate shot out.png --launch mvn compile exec:exec -Dautomation=0
```

Say what the picture is *of* with options, and `ottermate` sets it first and stops if it cannot. Everything before
`--launch` is ottermate's; everything after it is the application's command line (on Windows, `mvn.cmd`):

```
ottermate --zoom 1.5 --dpi 2 --size 1600x900 shot big.png --launch ...   # pixels
ottermate --size 36emx20em shot smallest.png --launch ...                # the minimum, in em
```

The landmarks in `Landmarks.java` are the names a script uses: `await status.file notes.md` waits for a file to be in
front, and `await path <folder>` for the navigator to be showing one. `ottermate help` lists every verb.

## Logging

The framework configures logging for you, before anything else runs, and the defaults follow what kind of run it is:

| Run | Console | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a test | warnings | none |
| from your checkout (`mvn exec:exec`) | info | `target/logs/${appName}.log`, debug |
| driven by `ottermate` or `-Dautomation` | debug | `…/${appName}.log`, **trace**, with a probe trace beside it |
| a native image | warnings | `~/.${appName}/logs/${appName}.log`, info |

Write to it with a logger, not `System.out` — `Actions` does, as `${appName}.files`:

```java
private static final Log LOG = Log.of("${appName}.files");   // sibarum.probe.Log
LOG.warn("could not save {}", path, exception);               // the exception goes last; its stack reaches the file
```

`--log=debug` (or `off`) changes the level for one launch, and `-Dlog.level.${appName}.files=trace` raises one
logger. Levels, settings and the rules for what belongs at which level are in `atchung/docs/logging.md`.

## The two documents

`docs/framework-notes.md` and `docs/TODO.md` start nearly empty and are meant to be filled in as you go. See the note
at the top of the first one — it is the more important of the two.
