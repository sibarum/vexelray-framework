/**
 * One open file: its {@link TextField}, its spans, and what a save needs to know.
 *
 * <p>The text is the field's own {@code State<Document>}. Whether it is saved is the field's undo history's answer
 * ({@code History.mark()} and {@code clean()}) — the history already knows which state the user last saved, so
 * this keeps no flag of its own for that beyond the one case the history cannot express.
 *
 * <h2>Spans, off the GUI thread</h2>
 *
 * <p>A Markdown file gets {@link Markdown#spans} after every edit. Computing them is a pass over the whole text, so
 * it runs on {@link Gui#async}, and the result is handed to the field only if it is still current: a generation
 * counter drops a run that a newer edit overtook, and the text is checked against what was read, because spans
 * computed for one text attached to another are colours on the wrong characters.
