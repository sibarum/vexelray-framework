/**
 * Everything the application knows about its session, in one immutable value: which files are open, in what
 * order, which one is in front, which have unsaved work, which folder the navigator shows, and the last thing the
 * status line was told.
 *
 * <h2>Why a record, and why one</h2>
 *
 * <p>A snapshot rather than a set of fields somebody mutates. The title bar, the status line, the close gate and
 * the remembered session all read this from different threads while handlers write it from workers, and a record
 * handed over by a single reference swap is the whole synchronisation story: there is no instant at which a reader
 * sees half an edit. Add fields here rather than adding state elsewhere.
 *
 * <h2>What it does not hold is the text</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each document's text is already one versioned value — the {@code State<Document>} inside its
 * {@code TextField} — so copying it here would be a second place it lives, and the two would disagree for a frame
 * every keystroke. This is the part nothing else owns: the shape of the session.
 *
 * <p>A tab is named by an {@code id}, not an index. An index is a fact about the tab bar at one instant, and a
 * close landing between a read and a write turns it into the neighbour's.
