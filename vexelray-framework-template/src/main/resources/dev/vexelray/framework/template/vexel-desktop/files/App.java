/**
 * ${summary}
 *
 * <h2>What this class is</h2>
 *
 * <p>The entry point, and the constants the rest of this package reads. That is all it is, and the reason is
 * worth knowing before anything else here: <b>the application edge is the framework's.</b> Opening an input
 * backend, installing a clipboard, remembering where the window was, attaching a clock, wiring the frame loop with
 * its wakes and its pacing, installing the dialogs, parsing the command line and closing everything in the right
 * order are all done for you.
 *
 * <p>What this application builds — a text editor with tabs and a file navigator — is in {@link Recipes}, one
 * method per part. {@code ${className}AppWiring}, which builds those parts in order, is generated from them and from
 * the {@code @VexelApp} on {@code ${className}App} while the project compiles — so the facts below are stated once,
 * here, and the wiring reads them.
 *
 * <pre>
 * ${className}                     the editor, on the folder it was last showing (or the working directory)
 * ${className} &lt;path&gt;...          open these: a folder becomes the navigator's root, a file a tab
 * ${className} &lt;frames&gt;            run a fixed number of frames and quit (a script, not a session)
 * ${className} --key=value         override a setting for this launch
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A misspelled flag is refused by name with the alternatives listed, rather than a stack trace before any
 * window. Needs {@code --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED}.
 *
 * <p><b>Two editions declare the application.</b> {@code ${className}App} is in {@code src/edition-debug} and
 * {@code src/edition-release}, and the pom compiles one of them. Its {@code starters} is everything configuring this
 * application beyond {@link Recipes}, listed rather than discovered. The debug edition's names
 * {@code AutomationStarter}, the driving socket; the release edition names none, and {@code -Pnative-release} drops
 * the automation modules from the class path, so the shipped binary links no socket at all. Everything else — a
 * plain build, {@code exec:exec}, the tests, {@code -Pnative} — is the debug edition.
