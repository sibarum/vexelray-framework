/**
 * The one authoritative {@link Doc}, and the only way to change it.
 *
 * <h2>Relative edits, not absolute writes</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every change here is a <em>function applied to whatever the current value turns out to be</em>, committed
 * through {@link State}. A tab closing on one worker and a document going dirty on another both land, in some
 * order, and neither is lost. The alternative — read the value, compute a whole new one, write it back — produces
 * something perfectly coherent with one change missing whenever two handlers overlap, and nothing reports it.
 *
 * <p>One generic committer rather than one per command. The names would be the vocabulary a replicated peer binds
 * to, and nothing replicates this; splitting it is a mechanical change the compiler drives when something does.
 *
 * <h2>Handlers run on workers; this is the serialisation point</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing else in this application needs a lock for the session's shape, and if something starts to, that is
 * the signal that state has escaped this class. ({@link Workspace} has a lock, and it guards the widgets' tab
 * order, not this.)

     * commit from a pool — so two finishing together reach a listener as version 6 then 5, and a listener that

     * somewhere else, can be overtaken by an older delivery; read {@link #doc()} inside it rather than trusting the
